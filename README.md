GmailBackup
===========

A simple python script to backup all of your Gmail emails and attachments to your desktop.

I have tested this on both Windows 8 and OSX 10.6 and up. 

On a Mac (Linux should work this way too):
  1. Open a terminal window
  2. cd to the directory where backitup.py is located
  3. 'python backitup.py'
  4. Follow the prompts

On a PC: I can't remember at the moment how I ran this on Windows...will update soon

*note when typing your gmail account name do not include '@gmail.com'
I have used this on an email account that is hosted by google but maintained by another institution. For instance 'username@denison.edu' works when entering a username.
